        <p>         
          Understanding life at an atomistic level, with the ultimate aim of improving human health, has been my main interest since the beginning of my scientific journey. This motivation stems from a deeply personal experience: when my mother was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, I was struck by how little could be done to treat the disease, and I found myself asking fundamental questions about the molecular and immunological processes behind it. Reading widely in search of answers, I encountered Eric Drexler’s ideas on nanotechnology and became fascinated by the potential of molecular-level science to transform medicine. This realization led me to pursue a degree nanosciences.
        </p>
        <p>
          During my bachelor’s studies, I conducted a thesis work in the field of virology. My project focused on the assembly and disassembly dynamics of viral capsids, with the goal of repurposing them as molecular vehicles for targeted drug delivery. Although my approach at that time was experimental, this experience introduced me to the world of computational biology with molecular dynamics. Progress was challenging due to difficulties with virus expression, which even led me to travel abroad to obtain new viral genetic material. Coupled with the financial hardships of supporting my education largely on my mother’s disability pension, these obstacles demanded creativity and perseverance qualities that remain among my strongest assets today. Ultimately, we obtained sequential electron microscopy images and were able to describe capsid behavior at the micromolecular level. Yet, I was left with a sense of dissatisfaction: I wished to understand these dynamics at true atomic resolution.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was awarded a CONACyT scholarship to pursue a Master’s degree, where I transitioned to fully in silico methods to model and simulate a combination of macromolecules, never simulated in the lab before. This phase of my training allowed me to work at atomic precision and strengthened my conviction that computational tools would be central to the future of biomedical discovery. During this stage of my career, I learned to take a leading role in a research project while working in close coordination with my team.
        </p>
        <p>
          All of these experiences have prepared me for and now shape my role as a Ph.D. candidate in Chemistry & Biochemistry at UC San Diego, where I am part of the Amaro Lab. I am dedicated to advancing computational drug discovery and the simulation of biological systems. The focus on Tthe program of Theoretical and Computational Chemistry has been an ideal match for my research interests, providing the advanced training I had long sought to pursue. Over the past years, I have built on this foundation by applying deep learning and molecular simulation tools for drug discovery, convinced that the future of biomedical and pharmacological innovation lies in harnessing these computational approaches.
        </p>
         <p>
          Looking ahead, I aspire to develop computational methods that bridge mathematics and health, with the goal of advancing safer and more effective therapies that directly improve patients lives. I hope to pursue this vision within industry, where I can contribute to translating scientific innovation into applied healthcare solutions.
